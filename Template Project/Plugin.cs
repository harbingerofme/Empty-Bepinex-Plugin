///     Make sure your references are located in a "libs" folder that's sitting next to the project folder.
///         This folder structure was chosen as it was noticed to be one of the more common structures.
///     Add a NuGet Reference to Mono.Cecil. The one included in bepinexpack3.0.0 on thunderstore is the wrong version 0.10.4. You want 0.11.1.
///         You can do this by right clicking your project (not your solution) and going to "Manage NuGet Packages".
///    Make sure the AUTHOR field is correct.
///    Make sure the MODNAME field is correct.
